# General

We need a fancy application, with backend and frontend, which consume the public API of
Rick & Morty: https://rickandmortyapi.com. This API should be consumed from your backend
application, not directly from the frontend.
We need these functionalities:
• Login
The users need to be authenticated to consume the application. The auth have to keep
the state between reloads.
• List all character’s view
An indicator to know if a character is in fav list.
• Detail character’s view
A button to add the character to a fav list, in case the character is in fav list it will be
removed from fav list.
• 404 page

# Rules

• The frontend will be made in React with Hooks and Redux. Feel free if you want to add
more JS libraries but if you do that, please, tell us in the Readme.md file why did you
choose them. Design is free.
• The backend will be made in Express. Feel free if you want to add more JS libraries but
if you do that, please, tell us in the Readme.md file why did you choose them.
• Please, don’t use styles libraries like Bootstrap or Material. We need to know your skills
and we assume the application won't be a stellar designed app.
• Make focus on quality. We won’t care a lot if you don't finish all points, but we will
care a lot the quality of what you created.
• The user information for login should be stored in a DB. Feel free to choose the DB you
consider.
• When a user saves characer in fav list it should be reflected on DB. Feel free to choose the
DB you consider.
• The application must be delivered in a repo. If you want to keep it in secret just create a
fake account in GitHub.

# Extra points (optional)

These extra points are not mandatory. If you have time and desire go ahead!
• Add test. Feel free to decide how and where.
• Add a register page for new users.
• Add backend pagination
• Preload images and add a loader
• Take a beer, you worked a lot!
